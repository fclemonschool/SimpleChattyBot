  <p>Patrick has created a function <code class="java">updateRapper</code> that helps him update the name of his favorite rapper within his Go program. When he tried to execute his program, his function couldn't update the values of the variables <code class="java">firstName</code> and <code class="java">lastName</code>.</p> 
  <p>Can you help Patrick fix the <code class="java">updateRapper</code> function? He needs the function to specifically update <code class="java">firstName</code> to <em>Kanye</em> and <code class="java">lastName</code> to <em>West</em>, as <em>Kanye West</em> is his new favorite rapper.</p>
