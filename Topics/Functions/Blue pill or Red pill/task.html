  <p>Keanu has been learning about Go functions and has created a function <code class="java">takePill</code> that asks the user of the program to pick the red or the blue pill. However, he forgot to call his function within the <code class="java">main</code> function!</p> 
  <p>Can you help out Keanu by fixing his code and calling his function properly ?</p>
