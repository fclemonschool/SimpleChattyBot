<h2>Working with simple chess match dataset</h2>
<html>
 <head></head>
 <body>
  <p>Imagine we design a machine that stores and loads chess results between 2 competitors. Each battle has 3 matches. The result is the color of the winner. For example, <em>White White Black </em>means that the white side has won the first and the second match and the black side has won the third match.</p> 
  <p>Now we have a dataset that stores the result of 5 battles. Can you implement the additional code required to print this dataset in the same format as below?</p> 
  <p>Note that the new line <code class="java">\n</code> and tab <code class="java">\t</code> characters will not be interpreted within backticks. For an easier time solving this task, you should not change the indents in the code snippet of the task prepared for you.</p> 
  <pre><code class="java">White White Black
Black Black White
White Black White
Black White Black
Black Black Black</code></pre>
