  <p>Lee is working on a Go program that represents the famous Korean "honeycomb game". In his program, he wants the user to pick and input into the program one of the following shapes, based on emojis: ‚≠ï (Circle), üî∫ (Triangle), ‚≠ê (Star) and ‚òÇÔ∏è (Umbrella).</p> 
  <p>Lee has almost finished his code, but he has many syntax errors within his <code class="java">switch</code> statement. Can you help him fix the errors?</p>
