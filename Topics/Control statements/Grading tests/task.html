  <p>Anny has just finished learning about the <code class="java">if</code> and <code class="java">else</code> statements. She wants to implement them in her Go program that checks if a student passed the test with a minimum score of 71 out of 100 points.</p> 
  <p>If the student has scored 71 points or more, the program should print "Passed!" and if the student has scored less than 71 points, it should print "Failed!". Can you help her write a program that can validate the score of the students?</p>
